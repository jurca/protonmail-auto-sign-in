# Protonmail automatic sign-in

Google Chrome extension for automatic signing into the Protonmail service.

**Security notice:** This extension uses the `localStorage` API for storing
your password. This storage is not secure, and cannot be secured unless
encrypted by a password (in which case the point for this extension would
vanish). It is therefore recommended to have the hard drive encrypted, protect
your computer account by a strong and secure password, and lock your screen
when away from the computer when using this extension.
